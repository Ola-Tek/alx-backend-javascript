What are Promises?
From understanding, promises are constructors which are used for asynchronous operations. the help to conttol the execution of a code base without affecting the work flow of the badic program.
There are two badic executors assigned to promises:
1. Resolve
2. Reject

These two executors help handle instances when its a success or when its a failure.
There are also handlers associated with Promises:
.then
.catch
.finally
